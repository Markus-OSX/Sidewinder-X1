# Sidewinder-X1
Stuff about my Artillery Sidewinder X1 (MKS Gen L 1.0)

Here you will find the Printer.cfg for use with Klipper on a Raspberry Pi 4 and Artillery Sidewinder X1 with MKS Gen L 1.0 Controller-Board, BlTouch Sensor for Mesh-Bed Leveling and the RasPi IR-Camera.

You need to set up the pi and Sidewinder before using this ;o)
